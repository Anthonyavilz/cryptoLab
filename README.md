Cybersecurity Breache - Microsoft 

Back in Jan. 2021, there was over 30,000 business effected by a breach that ulitized the Microsoft Exchange email servers. It used something called Zero-Day vulnerabilities to give unauthorized access to emails of small businesses/goverments. While Microsoft was able to patch the vulnerabilities, if people effected didn't manually update their systems, they hacker group could still gain access. Since the attackers were able to gain access to the system, the emails/authorized looked internal so it went on for 3 months. It was initally thought that a group called Hafnium was behind the attack which is a group based out of China. The group has historically targeted different U.S sectors such as law offices, infectious disease centers, and other large U.S sectors
