Cybersecurity Breache - Microsoft 
1. Back in Jan. 2021, there was over 30,000 business effected by a breach that ulitized the Microsoft Exchange email servers. It used something called Zero-Day vulnerabilities to give unauthorized access to emails of small businesses/goverments. While Microsoft was able to patch the vulnerabilities, if people effected didn't manually update their systems, they hacker group could still gain access. Since the attackers were able to gain access to the system, the emails/authorized looked internal so it went on for 3 months.
